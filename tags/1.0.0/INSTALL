Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Artha can be installed from source on most GNU/Linux systems easily, by
running the following commands in the source base directory:

$ ./configure
$ make

And then switching to 'root' (through 'su' or 'sudo') and running:
# make install

Artha could then be started by running 'artha'. 

It is recommended to add Artha to your list of start-up programs. For example, 
in GNOME, this is done through 'Sessions' in the System -> Preferences menu.

By default, Artha gets installed in /usr/local. Should you wish to change 
the default installation path, you can do so by setting the 'prefix' parameter 
of configure. Usually this prefix param is passed with /usr argument, since 
most applications have /usr as their base directory.

e.g.
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr

which will configure Artha to get installed in /usr.


System Requirements
-------------------
Artha has been tested and is known to run well on several GNU/Linux 
distributions and on i386, x86-64 & PPC platforms, but will probably run 
well on other UNIX-like systems (BSD, Solaris, etc.) and architectures too.

In order to build artha, as described above, you will need the following 
"development" libraries installed (typical binary package names are given 
within braces):

	- wordnet  	>= 3.0		(wordnet-dev)
	- glib     	>= 2.14		(libglib2.0-dev)
	- gtk+     	>= 2.12		(libgtk2.0-dev)
	- dbus-glib	>= 0.74		(libdbus-glib-1-dev)

WordNet can be obtained from http://wordnet.princeton.edu/obtain. Debian & 
Fedora based operating systems may have the package in their repositories.

Optionally, Artha will use the following "runtime" libraries, if they are 
available:
	- notify	(libnotify.so.1)
	- enchant	(libenchant.so.1)


These 2 libraries are not mandatory for building Artha; however if they are 
not present, additional features - passive desktop notifications and spelling 
suggestions - will not be exposed by Artha.

You will also need GNU's gcc and autotools (autoconf and automake) to build.
