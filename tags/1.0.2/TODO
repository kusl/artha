Users' Wish List:
* Pronunciations
* Persistent History
* Ctrl + W should work for closing the window and Ctrl + Q should quit.
* Make the status icon's visibility customizable as Always, Never and Auto.

To Do:

* Help docs and Preferences windows are to be added with few more features.

* Ctrl + Z / Undo feature is to be added, particularly to the search text bar.

* When in minimized mode, with notifications, just look up the synonyms, which 
  should reduce a lot of overhead. When the try icon is clicked, then do the actual 
  WORDNET_INTERFACE_ALL request call, till then this flag can be deferred.

* When in simple mode, see the 'Parts' tab for 'rupee', it has lot of duplicates.

* Change Kind of (Hyperyms) to Kind of/Way to and Kinds (Hyponyms) to Kinds/Ways

* Should Similar be made as 'Similar/Related/See also'? Checkout Hinduism's similar.

* Keep 2 buttons expand all/contract all for relative trees

* Try, when the window is visible, searching 'man' and do the same when in tray 
  (with notifications). Performance is differing? (Once the performance got hit 
  when it was visible, but not very sure)

* Clearing search history

* Auto complete of the query combo using history or the whole dict. index?

* Wrapped text should get aligned with the definition start and not the sense count start

* Check if this is possible => farcry should be separated into "far cry" and searched
