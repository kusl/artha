.SH NAME
Artha \- An open cross-platform thesaurus based on WordNet
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBArtha\fP is an open thesaurus based on the WordNet database, 
created with simplicity in mind. Once executed, Artha stays on the 
system tray, monitoring for a set global hot key combination. When 
the user selects some text in any window, and presses this set hot 
key combo, Artha looks up WordNet for the selected text and pops-up 
with the results.
.PP
The hot key combo selection is done by Artha is in this order:
.IP
	* Ctrl + Alt + W
.IP
	* Ctrl + Alt + A
.IP
	* Ctrl + Alt + T
.IP
	* Ctrl + Alt + Q
.IP
i.e. when executed, Artha tries to register a hot key for it. First 
it tries to register Ctrl + Alt + W, if it is already occupied by 
some other application, it tries for Ctrl + Alt + A, likewise until 
it succeeds. If all the above listed 4 combinations are taken up 
by other applications, Artha disables its hot key call and 
notifications features. Hence its highly recommened that the user 
keeps atleast one of these combinations free, so as to use all the 
features of Artha effectively. When running, the current hot key 
set can be known from the About dialog.
.PP
Definitions are categorized based on the PoS (Part of Speech - Noun, 
Verb, Adjective and Adverb). Apart from showing the definitions/senses 
of a searched string with usage examples, Artha also shows a word's 
relatives like Synonyms, Antonyms, Derivatives, Pertainyms 
(Related noun/verb), Attributes, Similar Terms, Domain/Domain Terms, 
Causes, Entails, Hypernyms (is a kind of), Hyponyms (Kinds), 
Holonyms (is a part of), Meronyms (Parts).
.PP
A word can have more then one sense i.e. it can convey more than a 
single meaning/definition. Relative words are words that are related 
to one or more senses of the searched word, by a relationship like 
Synonym, Derivative, etc. To know which all sense a relative is 
related to, just select the it, the corresponding senses it maps to 
are highlighted. As per WordNet, depending on the number of senses a 
word has (polysemy count), it's familiarity is determined. It gets 
displayed next to the PoS in the definition area. There are 7 
types: extremely rare, very rare, rare, uncommon, common, familiar, 
very familiar and extremely familiar.
.PP
Artha has 2 modes. Simple and Detailed. Artha enters Detailed mode 
when the 'Detailed' button in the toolbar is pressed. When toggled 
again, it returns back to simple mode. For relatives like Antonyms, 
Pertainyms, Hypernyms, Hyponyms, Holonyms and Meronyms, where more 
than one level of relatives may be present, is showed in a tree 
fashion, in detailed mode. If in simple mode, only one level of 
relatives are shown even when more levels are present. E.g. 'rich' 
has 'poor' and 'lean' alone as antonyms in simple mode. While in 
detailed mode, 'poor' further infers broke, skint, etc. which are 
shown as children of 'poor'.
.PP
Regular expressions can be used to search for a term when you vaguely 
know it and want to locate it in the thesaurus. Artha's regular 
expression pattern closely follows Wildmat syntax by Rich Salz owing 
to its simplicity.
.IP
* (wildcard) matches any number of (including 0) unknown characters
.IP
? (joker) matches one unknown character
.IP
[...] (range) matches one unknown character within the range specified
.IP
{m, n} (limits) upper & lower limits of the number of characters in 
a range
.IP
[^...] (not in the range) matches one unknown character NOT within 
the range specified
.IP
EXAMPLES:
.IP
Expr. 'cro*p' means the term you want to corner starts with 
'cro' and end with 'p' while the number of characters in between 
are unknown. It fetches crop, crop up, croup, crock up and crow step.
.IP
Exp. '*chester' means the word ends with a 'chester' while 
the beginning and its number characters are unknown. It fetches 
chester, manchester, rochester, winchester and toy manchester.
.IP
Expr. 'can????r' means the sought term starts with 'can' and 
ends with 'r' while you are sure that there are 5 unknown characters 
in between. It fetches canister and cannular.
.IP
Expr. 'andre*[x|y|z]' means the word starts with andre and ends 
with either an x or y or z, and there could be any number of terms in 
betweem these. It fetches andre malraux, andrei tarkovsky, andres 
martinez, etc.
.IP
Expr. 'a[c|d|e]{2,}' means the word looked for starts with a 
and then there are minimum 2 or more occurances of c, d or e. It 
fetches acc, accede, ace, add, ade and aec.
.IP
.PP
Should the user prefer system tray notifications (balloon tips), 
rather than the application popping up with the definitions, it can 
be done by enabling Notifications. This is done via the Notify 
tool button or by right-clicking on Artha's system tray icon, and 
tick off the 'Notifications' check box in the menu. When 
notifications are enabled, and the user selects text in a window 
and presses the hot key combo, Artha takes the prime definition of 
that term from WordNet and shows that definition as a system tray 
notification.
.PP
Note: For the notifications feature to be present, Artha should
have been compiled against that option. Also your system should 
have the notification-daemon installed. If not, Artha will not 
show the feature at all.
.PP
Suggestions is a feature that gives out possible near matches when 
a misspelled word is searched for. To have this feature, your system 
should have libenchant binaries installed and an English dict file 
for the engine to refer (locale doesn't matter).
