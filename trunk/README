=============================================================================

Overview
--------
Artha is a cross-platform open-source thesaurus with WordNet as its database.

The main focus of Artha is high usuability, with much simplicity. It has 
distinct features like hot key combo, notifications, etc. Once the application 
is launched, it sits in the system tray. The user can select text on any 
window, and call Artha by pressing the set hot key combination, which pops up 
Artha with the word looked-up. If the user wants notifications, rather than 
the app. popping up, it can be done by enabling notifications, which results 
in a (balloon tip) notification of the selected word's prime definition from 
WordNet, from the system tray, when the hot hey is pressed.

Technically, Artha is written in pure C using the GTK+ widget kit & Glib, 
making it cross-desktop and cross-platform. It uses libnotify for 
notifications. It may be used as a advanced replacement for WordWeb in 
GNU/Linux environments. Currently different flavours of GNU/Linux are targeted, 
but porting to other UNIX-like systems, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows will 
commence soon.
