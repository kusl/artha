.SH NAME
Artha \- An cross-platform thesaurus based on WordNet
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBArtha\fP is an open thesaurus based on the WordNet database, 
created with simplicity in mind. Once executed, Artha monitors for 
a user preset global hotkey combination. When the user selects 
some text in any window, and presses this hotkey combo, Artha 
looks up WordNet thesaurus for the selected text and pops-up 
with the results.
.PP
When executed for the first time Artha tries to register a hotkey 
automatically, in the order, Ctrl + Alt + [W or A or T or Q]. You 
can view/change it via the 'Hotkey' button in the toolbar. It 
can also be disabled.
.SH DEFINITIONS
Definitions are categorized based on the PoS (Part of Speech - Noun, 
Verb, Adjective and Adverb). Apart from showing the definitions/senses 
of a searched string with usage examples, Artha also shows a word's 
relatives like Synonyms, Antonyms, Derivatives, Pertainyms 
(Related noun/verb), Attributes, Similar Terms, Domain/Domain Terms, 
Causes, Entails, Hypernyms (is a kind of), Hyponyms (Kinds), 
Holonyms (is a part of), Meronyms (Parts).
.SS SENSES AND RELATIVES
A word can have more then one sense i.e. it can convey more than a 
single meaning/definition. Relative words are words that are related 
to one or more senses of the searched word, by a relationship like 
Synonym, Derivative, etc. To know which all sense a relative is 
related to, just select the it, the corresponding senses it maps to 
are highlighted. As per WordNet, depending on the number of senses a 
word has (polysemy count), it's familiarity is determined. It gets 
displayed next to the PoS in the definition area. There are 7 
types: extremely rare, very rare, rare, uncommon, common, familiar, 
very familiar and extremely familiar.
.SH MODES
Artha has 2 modes. Simple and Detailed. Artha enters Detailed mode 
when the 'Detailed' button in the toolbar is pressed. When toggled 
again, it returns back to simple mode. For relatives like Antonyms, 
Pertainyms, Hypernyms, Hyponyms, Holonyms and Meronyms, where more 
than one level of relatives may be present, is showed in a tree 
fashion, in detailed mode. If in simple mode, only one level of 
relatives are shown even when more levels are present. E.g. 'rich' 
has 'poor' and 'lean' alone as antonyms in simple mode. While in 
detailed mode, 'poor' further infers broke, skint, etc. which are 
shown as children of 'poor'.
.SH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS BASED SEARCH
Regular expressions can be used to search for a term when you vaguely 
know it and want to locate it in the thesaurus. Artha's regular 
expression pattern closely follows Wildmat syntax by Rich Salz owing 
to its simplicity.

.IP
? (joker) matches one unknown character

.SH OPTIONS
Look-ups made in Artha are stored permanently as a per-user setting, and
can be saved via the popup menu of the search bar or can be cleared too.
Other options like showing term familiarity based on polysemy count,
display of status icon, etc. can be changed via the Options window.
.SH NOTIFICATIONS
Should the user prefer passive desktop notifications (balloon tips), 
rather than the application popping up with the definitions, it can 
be done by enabling Notifications. This is done via the Notify 
tool button or by right-clicking on Artha's system tray icon, and 
tick off the 'Notifications' check box in the menu. When notifications 
are enabled, and the user selects text in a window and presses the 
hotkey combo, Artha takes the prime definition of that term from 
WordNet and shows that definition as a system tray notification.
.PP
Note: For the notifications feature to be present, notify library's 
binary (libnotify.so.1) should be available on your system. If not, 
Artha will not expose the feature at all. Also the notification-daemon 
should installed for the notifications to show up.
.SH SUGGESTIONS
Suggestions is a feature that gives out possible near matches when 
a misspelled word is searched for. To have this feature, your system 
should have libenchant binary (libenchant.so.1) installed and an 
English dict file for the spell engine to refer (locale doesn't matter).
.SH AVAILABILITY
Artha has a World Wide Web site at
\fBhttp://artha.sourceforge.net\fP. From this web site users can 
know more about the Artha project and also download its source and 
binary distributions for various distros.
