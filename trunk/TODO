Users Wish List:
* Make the status icon's visiblity customizable as Always, Never and Auto.
* Make hotkey customizable (hint: user GdkEventKey, which has the same
  Mod1Mask, etc. as its a wrapper to X11)

ToDo:

* Search for 4 words and then search a invalid word. When it says "failed", 
  press back and notice it goes to the the previous to previous word and not 
  the previoud word.

* Help docs and Prefernces windows are to be added.

* Peculiar glitch: When font size is set to 9 in the formatting of example in 
  defn. textview, and on searching "rambling" freezes. Just resize the window 
  vertically a wee bit, just a pixel maybe and see the issue is gone.

* When showing "Oops! Queried term not found!" as a notification, can show the 
  first few chars of what was queried for. E.g "'ied for' not found!"

* Should removed dependency on libnotify, by making it a pluggable module.

* Ctrl + Z / Undo feature is to be added, particularly to the search text bar.

* Watch the X selection. I.e. selecting text and calling Artha by pressing the 
  staus icon should make Artha come up with the definitions.

* When in minimized mode, with notifications, just look up the synonyms, which 
  should reduce a lot of overhead. When 'Lookup' is clicked, do the actual 
  WORDNET_INTERFACE_ALL request call, till then this flag can be defered.

* When the drop down list is too big, make sure, it doesn't exceed out of the 
  app. Instead let it have a scroll bar.

* When in simple mode, see the 'Parts' tab for 'rupee', it has lot of duplicates.

* Search 'slippage', and see that the tab set is incorrect

* When displaying antonym tree, if only direct antonyms exist, remove the parent 
  node ("Direct") alone e.g. orthodox

* Change Kind of (Hyperyms) to Kind of/Way to and Kinds (Hyponyms) to Kinds/Ways

* Keep 2 buttons expand all/contract all for relative trees

* Should Similar be made as 'Similar/Related/See also'? Checkout Hinduism's similar.

* Make sure you free or unref any object that gets newly created or referred

* Memory profiling should be done, check why it shoots from 3 to 9 to 12 to 
  15 MB when running (Check System Monitor)

* Try, when the window is visible, searching 'man' and do the same when in tray 
  (with notifications). Performance is differing? (Once the performance got hit 
  when it was visible, but not very sure)

* Try 'water' and then 'Vishnu' notice that the Holonyms/Part Of list's horizontal 
  scroll bar is not gone, when it should scroll to top once TextView is loaded with text

* Likewise scroll all the relative lists to top once they are populated

* Check tab order (gtk_container_set_focus_chain() can be used
  Source: http://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/articles/change-tab-order---Example-4.php)

* Bring to foreground should be effective even when the window is visible, but in 
  background (I.e. when z-order not 0)

* Clearing search history

* Auto complete of the query combo using history or the whole dict. index?

* Should the sense number be displayed as a column in relative lists like ATTRIBUTES, etc.?

* Wrapped text should get aligned with the definition start and not the sense count start

* Check if this is possible => farcry should be separated into "far cry" and sent to search

* Pronunciations
