* Saving on quit shouldn't be done. Saving on a change in a setting is more apt.

* Help docs and Prefernces windows are to be added.

* Ctrl + Z / Undo feature is to be added, particularly to the search text bar.

* Watch the X selection. I.e. selecting text and calling Artha by pressing the 
  staus icon should make Artha come up with the definitions.

* When in minimized mode, with notifications, just look up the synonyms, which 
  should reduce a lot of overhead. When 'Lookup' is clicked, do the actual 
  WORDNET_INTERFACE_ALL request call, till then this flag can be defered.

* See if, in case none of the hot key can be set, closing Artha should exit and not 
  minimize it to system tray, is required.

* Check for boundary value of the selection. I.e. if selection is over x, truncate 
  it before search.

* Make sure you do all the required trim, truncate, check for illegal chars 
  like ; : ~ " etc. and strip them before you send them to WNI

* When the drop down list is too big, make sure, it doesn't exceed out of the 
  app. Instead let it have a scroll bar.

* When in simple mode, see the 'Parts' tab for 'rupee', it has lot of duplicates.

* Search slippage, and see that the tab set is incorrect

* Create a list view for antonyms for simple mode case, with additional columns 
  like direct/indirect, via, etc.

* When displaying antonym tree, if only direct antonyms exist, remove the parent 
  node ("Direct") alone e.g. orthodox

* Reoder the relatives list such that all the tree are at the bottom 
  I.e. Pertainyms come before the BIG 4 (Hyper, Hypo, Holo & Mero) Order: Synonyms, 
  Antonyms, Attributes, Derivatives, Causes, Entails, Similar, Domain, Pertainyms, 
  Hypernyms,Hyponyms, Holonyms, Meronyms

* Change Kind of (Hyperyms) to Kind of/Way to and Kinds (Hyponyms) to Kinds/Ways

* Keep 2 buttons expand all/contract all for relative trees

* Should change the g_printf to debug level prints in WNI (See "Running GTK+ 
  Applications")

* Should Similar be made as 'Similar/Related/See also'? Checkout Hinduism's similar.

* Make sure you free or unref any object that gets newly created or referred

* Memory profiling should be done, check why it shoots from 3 to 9 to 12 to 
  15 MB when running (Check System Monitor)

* Try, when the window is visible, searching 'man' and do the same when in tray 
  (with notifications). Performance is differing? (Once the performance got hit 
  when it was visible, but not very sure)

* Try 'water' and then 'Vishnu' notice that the Holonyms/Part Of list's horizontal 
  scroll bar is not gone, when it should scroll to top once TextView is loaded with text

* Likewise scroll all the relative lists to top once they are populated

* Check tab order (gtk_container_set_focus_chain() can be used
  Source: http://www.kksou.com/php-gtk2/articles/change-tab-order---Example-4.php)

* Use Key-value file parser in GLib for settings file

* Double click on def. text should make a search again (GdkEvent). Also select 2 words 
  before and after to see if its there in the dict as a lemma

* Bring to foreground should be effective even when the window is visible, but in 
  background (I.e. when z-order not 0)

* Make sure when mouse scroll is made on cboQuery, you scroll thru' the history

* Clearing search history

* Auto complete of the query combo using history or the whole dict. index?

* Making hotkey customizable (hint: user GdkEventKey, which has the same Mod1Mask, 
  etc. as its a wrapper to X11)

* Should the sense number be displayed as a column in relative lists like ATTRIBUTES, etc.?

* Wrapped text should get aligned with the definition start and not the sense count start

* Try to see if this is possible => farcry should be separated into "far cry" and sent to search

* Pronunciations
