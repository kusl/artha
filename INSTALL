Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Artha can be installed from source on most GNU/Linux systems easily, by
running the following commands in the source base directory:

$ ./configure
$ make

And then switching to 'root' (through 'su' or 'sudo') and running:
# make install

Artha could then be started by running 'artha'. 

It is recommended to add Artha to your list of start-up programs. For example, 
in GNOME, this is done through 'Sessions' in the System -> Preferences menu.

By default, Artha gets installed in /usr/local. Should you wish to change 
the default installation path, you can do so by setting the 'prefix' parameter 
of configure. Usually prefix is used with /usr argument, since /usr is the 
usual base directory for program directories.

e.g.
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr

which will configure Artha to get installed in /usr.


System Requirements
-------------------
Artha has been tested and is known to run well on several GNU/Linux 
distributions & on i386 and x86-64 platforms, but will probably run well on
other UNIX-like systems and other architectures too.

In order to build artha, as described above, you will need the following 
"development" libraries installed (typical binary package names are given 
within braces):

- wordnet  >= 3.0	(wordnet-dev)
- glib     >= 2.10	(libglib2.0-dev)
- gtk+     >= 2.12	(libgtk2.0-dev)

Optionally, Artha may use the following "development" libraries, if they 
are available:
- notify   >= 0.4.1	(libnotify-dev)
- dbus     >= 1.0	(libdbus-1-dev)

These 2 libraries are not a must for building Artha, however they are a must 
to enable the Notifications feature of Artha.

You will also need some build tools such as GNU gcc and gtk-builder-convert. 
gtk-builder-convert is a part of libgtk2.0 development headers of version 
2.12 or later.
