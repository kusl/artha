Users' Wish List:
* Pronunciations
* Command-line interface (n/PDCurses)?
* i18n
* Option to make the hotkey a switch
* Single click jump to words in both senses and relatives as an option.
* Spacing issue; not all spaces are filled with '_' in the index files E.g. 24-karet_gold in index.noun
* WNI can used g_slist_free_full to make free code cleaner (but raises GLib to 2.28 version dependency)

To Do:

* Help docs and Preferences windows are to be added with few more features.

* Ctrl + Z / Undo feature is to be added, particularly to the search text bar.

* Wrapped text should get aligned with the definition start and not the sense count start
